# CodeVersioningWorkshopHomework

In this training, CDE team simulate on how important to use code versioning. They explain about Git and GitHub for code versioning and also to work in collaboration. GitHub is very useful as it reduces so many hustles in development collaboration. We can contribute in coding in each line of development using the branch. So in over all this training explains about:
- Code versioning
- Git branching
- Git merging
- Git pull request
- etc.

Git Branching
Branch allows us to work on multiple lines of development.
This is useful in the collaboration because each person can create his own branch without changing the master branch before got reviewed.
Creating branch is available using GitHub, we also can track how many branches created and when the changes is merge. 

Git Merging
Merge is to integrate the changes we made in one brach to another.
We can add git pull in order to fetch the updated code from the remote repository plus merging the changes from local to remote repository.
We need to do pull request first to get the review before merging the changes.

Git Pull Request
Before do the pull request ensure that we have committed the changes to the right branch. 
And then we can do git pull. In the GitHub, there will be reviewer who will review the pull request. Once it is approved, we can do merging into the master branch.
